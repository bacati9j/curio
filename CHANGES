CHANGES
-------

03/31/2016 Switched test suite to py.test. All of the tests are in the
           top-level tests directory.  Use 'python3 -m pytest' to test.

03/30/2016 Improved the curio monitor.  Instead of relying on the
           console TTY (and invoked via Ctrl-C), it now uses a socket
           to which you must connect via a different session. To
           enable the monitor either use:

               kernel = Kernel(with_monitor=True)

           or run with an environment variable

               env CURIOMONITOR=TRUE python3 yourprogram.py

           To connect to the monitor, use the following command:

               python3 -m curio.monitor
          
02/15/2016 Fixed Issue #37 where scheduling multiple tasks for sleeping
           could potentially cause a crash in rare circumstances.
