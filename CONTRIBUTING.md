Contributing to Curio
=====================

Curio is a young project and currently rather experimental.
Contributions of any kind that make it better are welcome--this
includes both code and documentation.

There aren't too many formal guidelines.  If submitting a bug report,
any information that helps to reproduce the problem will be handy.  If
submitting a pull request, try to make sure that Curio's test suite
still passes. Even if that's not the case, that's okay--a failed test
might be something very minor that can fixed up after a merge and some
review (if not, expect some discussion).  

It is not my goal to turn Curio into a gigantic framework with every
possible feature.  If you have built something useful that uses Curio,
it might be better served by its own repository.  Feel free to submit
a pull request to the Curio README file that includes a link to your
project.
