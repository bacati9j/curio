# Discussion:  Signal handling.
#
# Signal handling in Python is a tricky affair with the main
# restriction that almost nothing useful can be done outside
# of the main execution thread.  Plus, the fact that signal
# handling is already insane.
#
# The Curio approach to signals is to have signals delivered
# on a loopback socket (using signal.set_wakeup_fd) which is
# constantly monitored by a background thread.  This thread
# takes received signals and pushes them into queues subscribed
# to various signal numbers.  These queues can be registered
# and unregistered by various Curio tasks, threads, and other
# parts of the system.   This arrangement allows for a high-degree
# of flexibility.  For example, Curio allows signals to be 
# received by different threads.
